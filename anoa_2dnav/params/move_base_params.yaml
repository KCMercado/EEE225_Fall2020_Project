controller_frequency: 5.0
#The rate in Hz at which to run the control loop and send velocity commands to the base

controller_patience: 3.0
#How long the controller will wait in seconds without receiving a valid control before space-clearing operations are performed

planner_frequency: 10.0
#The rate in Hz at which to run the global planning loop. If the frequency is set to 0.0, the global planner will only run when a new goal is received or the local planner reports that its path is blocked

planner_patience: 3.0
#How long the planner will wait in seconds in an attempt to find a valid plan before space-clearing operations are performed

oscillation_timeout: 10.0
#How long in seconds to allow for oscillation before executing recovery behaviors. A value of 0.0 corresponds to an infinite timeout

oscillation_distance: 0.2
#How far in meters the robot must move to be considered not to be oscillating. Moving this far resets the timer counting up to the ~oscillation_timeout

recovery_behavior_enabled: true
#Whether or not to enable the move_base recovery behaviors to attempt to clear out space
