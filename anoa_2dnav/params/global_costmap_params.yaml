global_costmap:

  global_frame: "map"
  #defines what coordinate frame the costmap should run in
  
  robot_base_frame: "base_link"
  #defines the coordinate frame the costmap should reference for the base of the robot
  
  update_frequency: 5.0
  # determines the frequency, in Hz, at which the costmap will run its update loop
  
  publish_frequency: 0.5
  # determines the rate, in Hz, at which the costmap will publish visualization information
  
  static_map: false
  # determines whether or not the costmap should initialize itself based on a map served by the map_server
  
  rolling_window: true
  # 'true' means that the costmap will remain centered around the robot as the robot moves
  
  width: 20.0
  height: 20.0
  resolution: 0.02
  # "width," "height," and "resolution" parameters set the width (meters), height (meters), and resolution (meters/cell) of the costmap
