# determines the max sensor range reading that will result in an obstacle being put into the costmap

# robot will only update its map w/ info about obstacles that are 2.5 meters away from base

# deteremines the range to which we will rayrace freespace given a sensor reading
raytrace_range: 3.0
# the robot will attempt to clear our space in front of it up to 3 meters

# robot_radius: (use if robot is a circle

inflation_radius: 0.55
# the robot will treat all paths that stay 0.55 meters or more away from obstacles as having equal obstacle cost

observation_sources: laser_scan_sensor 

laser_scan_sensor: {sensor_frame: laser_frame, data_type: LaserScan, topic: scan, marking: true, clearing: true}
# RPLidar publishes /scan topice with frame name: laser_frame
# laser_frame is a tf frame that contains the Lidar
# "Marking" and "clearing" parameters determine whether the sensor will be used to add obstacle information to the costmap, clear obstacle information from the costmap, or do both.
